                                    Hey, my name is Jeremy Brensinger. I’m currently a level 4 student in the Web Design & 
                                    Web Programming lab at LCTI. I’ve been here for roughly 4 years, but what were the reasons 
                                    why I joined this lab in the first place, and why did I stick around for the last few years?
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h2 class="show-on-scroll">Interests In Programming</h2>
                                <p class="show-on-scroll">
                                    The main reason I joined Web Design & Web Programming was because of my interest in 
                                    programming, and wanting to be a video game developer from a young age. I’ve always 
                                    been interested in how programs work, specifically video games, but other programs too. 
                                    Before I started high school, my school allowed my class to take a trip to LCTI to see 
                                    what it was like there. We went through all the labs that LCTI had to offer, and the lab 
                                    that stood out the most was Web Design & Web Programming. The lab offered many different 
                                    specialties such as Web Developer, Software Developer, Graphic Designer, and Multimedia Animator. 
                                    There were amazing people in the lab and if I were to join, I would be able to follow my dreams 
                                    of becoming a video game developer/programmer. After visiting LCTI, I decided to go to LCTI once 
                                    I went to high school to try to get into Web Design & Web Programming, and after putting in a lot 
                                    of hard work and effort, I got into the Web Design & Web Programming lab. You might ask, “Why would 
                                    I join a lab when I can just learn how to program at home?” Well, when you have time taken out regular 
                                    schooling, and have that time put into something you actually enjoy, you would most likely choose 
                                    to go to LCTI. Not only that, but there are other reasons why I would want to learn at LCTI 
                                    instead of at home:

                                <p class="show-on-scroll">
                                    Another reason I joined Web Design & Web Programming was because I could attempt 
                                    to make new connections with great people. When joining this lab I knew I would 
                                    be meeting new people, and those people would most likely share the same interests 
                                    as me. Usually when people share the same interests as me, I find it easier to 
                                    connect with them, and become their friend. There were some people in the lab that 
                                    shared career interests with me as well as personal interests (video games, anime, 
                                    music, etc.). This made it a lot easier for me to have conversations with other people, 
                                    and allow me to befriend them. I was happy to meet so many great people in this lab that 
                                    I would most likely know for years to come.

                                    The last reason why I joined Web Design & Web Programming 
                                    was because I could train to be a professional. In this lab 
                                    I learned how to become a professional in many ways. Some of 
                                    these ways are utilizing soft skills to act professional, 
                                    and creating professional items such as portfolios and resumes. 
                                    I learned many soft skills such as teamwork, communication, problem solving, 
                                    taking responsibility, leadership, adaptability, decisiveness, time management, 
                                    and self motivation. These soft skills I’ve gained from this lab have without a 
                                    doubt made me more professional and ready for the future. I was also able to learn 
                                    how to create a resume and portfolio so I could showcase my skills, knowledge, 
                                    and previous work/experiences. With making these items, I have gained experience 
                                    on how to make them, and I can now use these in the future for jobs.
